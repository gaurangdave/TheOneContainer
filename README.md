## Why
I use VS Code remote containers a lot for all my development, experiments etc, and found it a easier way to share development environments between my machines and also with other fellow developers. 

## What
That is why I created this one container to rule them all. Basically for now this works perfect for all my pet projects and experiments. 

This container builds a development environment with following platform support, 

- NodeJS 14
- Mongo DB
- Go Lang 1.16
  - `protoc` 3.15
  - `protoc-gen-go` 1.26
  - `protoc-gen-go-grpc` 1.1
- Typescript
- Angular CLI
- NestJS Cli
- Fibase tools.


## TODO
- Add VSCode plusgins to `.devContainer` files to auto install all required plugs.
